              We encourage that all staff members should be made aware of the importance of sharing good
practice, with regards to curriculum matters as much as possible. Our British curriculum assists
our students, helping them to provide an environment where all of our pupils are able to
flourish, both physically and academically.

              </p>
              <p>
              The pursuit of academic excellence we believe should be supported and complemented by an
intellectual environment as we believe a British curriculum is one of the best ways of achieving
that.

              </p>
            
              <p>
