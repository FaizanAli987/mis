                  MIS is one of the few schools in Berlin to have its own nurse
                  on site â€“ giving parents peace of mind that children are cared
                  for in everyday and emergency situations. Our students can
                  visit the nurse at any time, whether for an in-the-moment
                  consultation or for help in managing a long-term health
                  condition.
                  <br />
                  As well as providing compassionate care to our kids, our
                  school nurse has also played a key role in overseeing our
                  school wide allergy-friendly environment. She is an invaluable
                  member of our school community.
