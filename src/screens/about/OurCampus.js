                <p>
                MIS takes the safety of its students extremely seriously and we pride ourselves to ensure that
every pupil in our care is safe at all times. The digital world is a huge part of peopleâ€™s life, IT and
online communications can provide beneficial, valuable support for learning, opportunities and
education, however at times the internet may pose a significant risk to young people.
Our students are therefore taught about the potential risks that may arise online and are taught
how to limit them; these risks may include but are not limited to:
<br/><br/>
Bullying<br/>
Fraud<br/>
Grooming<br/>
Stalking<br/>
Abusive behaviors<br/>
Malicious software<br/><br/>
